=========

Mobile-first, retina-friendly CSS starting point, using a Small (1x), Medium (2x), and Large (4x) image scaling system. Works with images or sprites.

## Basic Use

Image assets for a site should be created at 200% scale so they look crisp on high-pixel-density screens, such as a retina display.

By saving the assets at full size (img_lg), 50% (img_md), and 25% (img_sm), and then using sm/md/lg class tags, you create a reasonably simple way to set up image handling on a site, even with sprites.

The way it works: the small image is served by default (for mobile), the medium for desktop AND mobile retina, the large for desktop retina.
